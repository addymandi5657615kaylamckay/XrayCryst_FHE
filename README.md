# XrayCryst_FHE

**XrayCryst_FHE** is a privacy-preserving cloud platform for **X-ray crystallography data analysis** powered by **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.  
It enables researchers to upload encrypted diffraction images, compute electron density maps, and perform molecular structure refinement ‚Äî all without ever exposing raw experimental data to cloud providers or third parties.

## Introduction

Modern structural biology depends heavily on large-scale computation.  
High-resolution X-ray diffraction data collected at synchrotrons and free-electron lasers often require powerful cloud-based servers to reconstruct 3D electron density maps.  
However, this process exposes valuable and sensitive experimental data to external computing environments, raising **serious concerns about data ownership, intellectual property, and research confidentiality**.

**XrayCryst_FHE** was designed to bridge this gap ‚Äî combining **scientific computing** and **cryptographic privacy**.  
Through the integration of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, the platform enables full-scale crystallographic computation on encrypted diffraction patterns, ensuring that no intermediate or final step leaks raw data.

---

## Motivation

### The Problem
In conventional cloud workflows:
- Raw diffraction images must be decrypted before analysis.  
- Third-party computation providers may access or retain proprietary experimental results.  
- Intellectual property, especially for novel drug targets or structural discoveries, is at risk.

### The Solution
**FHE** allows arithmetic operations on encrypted numbers ‚Äî enabling mathematical processing without decryption.  
In **XrayCryst_FHE**, both intensity maps and Fourier transforms are executed homomorphically, preserving end-to-end confidentiality from data upload to structure output.

## Core Concept: FHE in Crystallography

Traditional X-ray crystallography requires:
1. **Fourier Transform computation** to convert diffraction patterns into real-space electron density maps.  
2. **Phase problem resolution** through iterative algorithms.  
3. **Model refinement** and least-squares fitting against experimental data.  

With FHE:
- These computations are performed directly on ciphertext representations of the data.  
- Mathematical integrity is preserved, and no decryption occurs in the cloud.  
- Only the researcher, holding the private key, can decrypt the final molecular structure.

This enables **scientific analysis on encrypted data**, marking a paradigm shift in computational crystallography.

## Architecture Overview

### System Layers

**1. Encryption Layer (Client-Side)**
- Diffraction images are encrypted locally using FHE schemes before upload.  
- Supports both CKKS (approximate arithmetic) and BFV (integer arithmetic) schemes.  
- Encryption ensures no unencrypted pixel or reflection intensity leaves the researcher‚Äôs device.

**2. Encrypted Compute Layer (Cloud)**
- Performs encrypted FFT, phase reconstruction, and electron density calculation.  
- Uses homomorphic matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation for Fourier-space operations.  
- Operates in a zero-trust environment: the cloud sees only ciphertext.

**3. Decryption & Visualization Layer**
- Final encrypted results (density maps or atomic coordinates) are downloaded by the user.  
- Decryption and visualization occur locally, integrating with standard molecular graphics tools.

## Workflow

1. **Local Encryption**  
   The researcher encrypts raw diffraction images using the client FHE SDK.

2. **Encrypted Upload**  
   Encrypted datasets are uploaded to the cloud.  
   No plaintext data is transmitted or stored.

3. **FHE Computation**  
   Cloud nodes perform:
   - Homomorphic Fourier Transform  
   - Phase retrieval via iterative algorithms  
   - Encrypted refinement steps  

4. **Encrypted Result Retrieval**  
   The user downloads the encrypted electron density map or model file.

5. **Local Decryption & Analysis**  
   Only the user can decrypt results to visualize molecular structures.
